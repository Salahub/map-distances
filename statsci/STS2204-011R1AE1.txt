[The paper ...] contains useful
information in re-deriving Haladane distance as a function of
recombination and reviewing its relevance for linkage-based
studies. However, since you stated that the journal's target for
"review articles" isn't just a literature review or an encyclopedia
reference, but rather a synthesis with suggestions for future
approaches, questions, or directions for research, it probably would
not be suitable.

I'm not sure what you should suggest to the author
for alternative target journals, it would probably make a good book
chapter on Haldane distance in an encyclopedia-style multi-author
reference.
