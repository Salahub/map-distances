The author presents an article that mathematically relates correlation
between quantitative traits (with a genetic basis) and genetic
distance.
It is not clear that this article contributes any concept, statistically
or genetically, that has not already been researched and discussed
for decades. Much of the text and formulae on crossovers and mapping
functions are well established in the literature.

While I concede that the exact relation between quantitative
correlative and Haldane mapping, as formulated accurately in Section
3, may not have been explicitly shown in literature, these can be
viewed as minor byproducts of long-existing models built for
quantitative trait mapping.  My criticisms are as follows-

1a) The fact that genetic proximity (quantified by a Halden model or
otherwise) between two genetic markers would result in higher
correlation in quantitative phenotypes (which we already know are
caused by such genes) is very obvious.
This could have been argued with much less algebra. The exact
mathematical form is less important, unless we can use it in a gene mapping
devise -- i.e, find causal genes with the help of potentially nearby
marker genes. The article never touches upon this point.
1b) If gene-mapping is really of interest, a full fledged model with
rigorous distributional assumptions (say Gaussian) on the traits would
have been more apt. Exploratory correlation analysis can only help to
validate such models, but cannot be an end in itself.


2) I find the claim of a novel derivation of Haldane's mapping
function in Section 2 to be inaccurate.  There already exists 
extensive literature on Haldaneâ€™s function with derivation techniques that
are minor variants of each other. I do not find the technique
discussed in this article to be at all different from those.
