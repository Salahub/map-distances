The paper was read by two expert referees, including one population
geneticist and myself.

We all three agree that the manuscript is an excellently written
tutorial paper, introducing the setup of GWAS studies and deriving
Haldane's formula. The paper is a delight to read.
But we unfortunately all three agree that the manuscript is not
suitable as an STS review paper. Please see the editorials by Rob Kass
and George Casella -- both are linked on the STS homepage ("editorial policy").
As both these former editors point out, a good STS review article
should draw together knowledge and highlight the critical advances in
a research area. It needs to be more than an (excellent) tutorial.

I believe the manuscript might be excellent for a journal like The
American Statistician, or any other journal that publishes good
tutorials and reviews.
